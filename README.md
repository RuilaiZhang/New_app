## Q12 User stories
As the full stack web developer of this app, I am in charge of adding new features and debugging and styling with one person. In this case, on the better side, it's easy for me to cooperate with myself without conflict, on the other side, the productivity and efficiency may be good as a whole development team. As the only developer, I have developed the database, authentication, authorized different users, some association, payment method, and styling of course. In the feature, I would like to add internal message features which is makes communicating between users become much easier. Also, I would like to add some security features to protect users' information since the database may get larger when more users come, protecting customers' personal information will become one of the most important issues.
